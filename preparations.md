# first things first
Sebastian made clear, that we reached many goals we've set. We should celebrate that!
# vision critic
what I don't like about the current vision:
- sounds like we are communicating with the customer, instead of sitting in between
- sounds like that the company has benefits and not the customer
- "enriched" is unclear
- "everywhere" sounds like the customer is everywhere, which is nothing special
- also that the agent could be everywhere is not special anymore
- why are there 5 visions?

my proposal: "Enable all businesses to have a call center"
- it is clear
- benefit is described
- a little bit catchy (my opinion!)
- it also describes limits
- but not much action

2nd proposal:
- the customers of our partners should have easier access to the support of our partners
- the communication between the customers and the support should be more effective
- "Enable every business to support their customers in an effective and effortless way"

# strategy critic
- everything below vision is strategy
- high-level story is missing
	- For (the target customers), Who (have a certain need), Our product is a (product category), That provides (compelling reason to buy). Unlike (the product alternative), Our product (has these key differentiators).
- target group & their needs should be well-founded, where is the input from the experts? where is the market research? where are the roadmap themes and their prioritization? still no transparency
- focus on one target group, this is enough work: if we don't focus, we don't fit to anyone
- where is the proof that chat takes over calls?
- If I would operate a call center like embers, my operators would be my eyes & ears: shouldn't we focus on them?

## target group
- why just europe? because we just have servers in Berlin, not in Asia or America, timezone is not the real problem here
- Ecommerce? Older people want talk over browser, younger people prefer virtual shopping cart -> very special ecommerce, like Vertbaudet or luxury brands, which needs more customer service -> but then we need to look much more fancy or playful
- Why tourism? I mean, also car sellers could be placed there. Everyone who needs telephony?
- Hospitality, because we have PCI, SSD and are in Germany? We need to integrate their existing telephony then
- Telehealth - then our interfaces must be a lot easier
## needs
- assist customers? that really depends on our partner
- communication at scale? I don't understand
- conversations across channels + devices? the need is there, but a) a lot of work, never ending b) e-mail should be prio
- gain insight about business, products, services, users? the need is there, but even more work
- convert visitors into prospects, customers or clients? why is that our resposibility? shouldn't our partner do that?
- reduce churn? not our responsibility, that really depends on our partner
- personalized experience? through AI or what is the idea?
- automate communication workflows? ok
- security + privacy? ok
- identify customers with context? sounds like CMS, how many stacks of work do you want to put here?
## product
- voice, video and messaging suite? a lot of work
- omnichannel? a ton of work
- responsive user interface? I bet Nerijus has a lot of ideas for improvements
- customization & branding: pretty basic
- data retention & privacy: ok
- PCI: ok
- easy integration: of what? call providers? our partner's SIP phones? CMS? the widget?
## business goals
- generate direct revenue from subscriptions + usage? that is very hard (https://www.revenuecat.com/state-of-subscription-apps-2023/)
- acquire new accounts from end customers? Mediashop? I don't understand
- decrease CAC? which costs do we have?
## competitors
- cloud telephony solutions? ok
- chat applications? we're loosing against every basic chat, we don't even have emojis or file sharing
- ticket systems? we don't have a ticket system, how are we their competitor?
- self-service? I don't understand
## revenue streams
- self-selling freemium model? that is very hard
- user subscriptions? that is very hard
- conversations? how do we want to make money in other channels than calls? this basic chat will be used by nobody
- add-ons? ok
## cost factors
 - ok, ok, ok, ok, ok
## channels
- website? needs rework, but we are on it
- end customer UI? if somebody would use our widget, then this could be possible, but is very unlikely
- in-app conversion + upselling? that is very hard
- organic social? we need branding!
- newsletter? we have a newsletter? we want to have a newsletter?
- marketplaces? I don't understand
- product review / vendor portals? ok, but I don't know if that would work
- paid social? some examples?

# open points
- not everybody knows how to add ideas
- what happens with these ideas?
- how will Sebastian guide us / give feedback?
- how do we give him feedback?

# about customer chat in roadmap
in the roadmap we want to make a customer chat. the unusual thing about the chat is the possibility to switch to video. but i can't upload a file, what about emojis, customer survey, triggering actions like signing a contract. what problem can't i solve with a photo that i can solve with video? video-ident you do once and then you are registered.
