# Democracy
participation of all people in the formation of political will
tries to have equal opportunity, representation & rights for everyone.

## History

The idea of democracy comes from the natural law theory, that all people have inherent rights (by god, nature or reason), which also developed to the human rights.

### Ancient world

Only free man could speak and vote. Women, slaves and men without full citizenship had no political rights.

e.g. attic democracy, only 30 - 50.000 from 250 - 300.000 could vote

#### Plato

Only the most capable should govern. But the ability to get votes is different from the ability to rule a country. Only the people who proved their competence should rule.
Everybody should have equal educational opportunities, access to education without money.

Corruption will drive the citizens to unfollow the rules of the democracy. The politicians should focus on governance and not their personal interests. A system is needed to ensure this. Then it is efficient.

What we need:
- leaders that overcome corruption
- universal education
- hierarchies based on competence

#### Aristotle

wrote the book "politics", where he analyses different forms of government

### Modern Democracy

In the 19th century, the meaning of democracy changed. Founding fathers of the USA wanted a republic, not a democracy, same in the france revolution. That changed later and was notioned as the modern form of democracy.

characteristics:
- restricted majority rules
- elections
- representative transfer of power

### Liberal Democracy
-  universal, free and secret elections
- seperation of powers: legislative (congress), executive (president), judicial (supreme court)
- state of law (peace through law), see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechtsstaat
- market economy (there are also socialist market economies)
- human, civil & political rights
- civil liberties (freedom of conscience, freedom of press, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the right to security and liberty, freedom of speech, the right to privacy, the right to equal treatment under the law and due process, the right to a fair trial, and the right to life) guaranteed by a constitution

## Justification

Democracy creates relatively good laws and policies:
- democracy gives each subject a share of political power, democracy forces decision-makers to take into account the rights and interests of a wider range of subjects than are taken into account under aristocracy or monarchy
- no substantial famine has ever occurred in any independent country with a democratic form of government and a relatively free press. (Sen 1999: 152). The basis of this argument is that politicians in a multiparty democracy with free elections and a free press have incentives to respond to the expressions of needs of the poor

Character building:
- Many agree with Mill and Rousseau that democracy tends to make people stand up for themselves more than other forms of rule do because it makes collective decisions depend on their input more than monarchy or aristocracy do. Hence, in democratic societies individuals are encouraged to be more autonomous. Relatedly, by giving citizens a share of control over political-decision-making, democracy cultivates citizens with active and productive characters rather than passive characters.
- In addition, it has been argued that democracy tends to get people to think carefully and rationally more than other forms of rule because it makes a difference to political outcomes whether they do or not.
- Finally, some argue that democracy tends to enhance the moral qualities of citizens. When they participate in making decisions, they have to listen to others, they are called upon to justify themselves to others and they are forced to think in part in terms of the interests of others. Some have argued that when people find themselves in this kind of circumstance, they can be expected genuinely to think in terms of the common good and justice.

## Cons
- Most people do not have the kinds of intellectual talents that enable them to think well about the difficult issues that politics involves. But in order to win office or get a piece of legislation passed, politicians must appeal to these people’s sense of what is right or not right. Hence, the state will be guided by very poorly worked out ideas that experts in manipulation and mass appeal use to help themselves win office.
- Mill defends a form of epistocracy that is sometimes referred to as the “plural voting” scheme (1861: ch. 4). While all rational adults get at least one vote under this scheme, some citizens get a greater number of votes based on satisfying some measure of political expertise.
- Hobbes: individual citizens and even politicians are apt not to have a sense of responsibility for the quality of legislation because no one makes a significant difference to the outcomes of decision making. As a consequence, citizens’ concerns are not focused on politics and politicians succeed only by making loud and manipulative appeals to citizens in order to gain more power, but all lack incentives to consider views that are genuinely for the common good. Hence the sense of lack of responsibility for outcomes undermines politicians’ concern for the common good and inclines them to make sectarian and divisive appeals to citizens.
- A good deal of empirical data shows that citizens of large-scale democracies are ill-informed and apathetic about politics. This makes room for special interests to control the behavior of politicians and use the state for their own limited purposes all the while spreading the costs to everyone.
